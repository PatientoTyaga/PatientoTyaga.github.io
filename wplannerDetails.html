									<p>Workout Planner is a user-friendly app designed to assist individuals in organizing their workout routines, whether it be planned in advance or on the fly. It empowers users to seamlessly arrange and monitor their workouts with ease.</p>
									<p>This app is designed for gym-goers who like to schedule their workouts beforehand or on the go. It provides users with the ability to plan their workouts and keep track of completed exercises as well as those remaining for the day. The two features, Randomize and Custom, bring this idea to fruition.</p>
                                    <p>In the Custom feature, users will find a selection of categories corresponding to different body parts they intend to target. Within each category, users will discover a variety of exercises to perform. This feature caters to individuals who prefer focusing on specific body parts during their workouts. Whether one aims to train the chest exclusively or any other muscle group, they can easily select their desired category from here.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you're looking to shake up your routine or engage in a full-body workout, the Randomize feature is tailored for you. Within this feature, users will encounter the same categories available in Custom. However, the distinction lies in the selection process: from the list of exercises within each category, two will be randomly chosen and added. This means that if you select all categories, you'll end up with two random exercises from each, providing a diverse full-body workout. By incorporating exercises chosen at random, users can experience variation in their workouts. This process can be repeated for subsequent workouts, offering the possibility of different full-body workout experiences each time, although it's not limited to full-body workouts.</p>

									<h2>Motivation behind workout planner</h2>
									<p>As someone who hits the gym regularly, I've often found myself relying on the notepad app on my phone to keep track of my workout plans. It's a routine of jotting down exercises, erasing, and repeating the process every day. But then I had a thought: why not make this whole planning thing easier and maybe even a bit more enjoyable? That's when I came up with the idea for the Workout Planner. Now, I can switch things up â€“ dedicating one day to focus on a specific muscle group and the next day to a full-body workout, all with a variety of exercises to keep things interesting. It's all about making the gym experience smoother and more fun!</p>
